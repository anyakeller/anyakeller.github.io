                        <h2>A Not-so-brief Intro</h2>
                        <p>
                            Beginning with education, I graduated from
                            Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 2017. I
                            look back at my time at Stuyvesant as one of the
                            most influential and inspirational parts of my life.
                            I thoroughly enjoyed my physics class and AP physics
                            class, math, english, social studies, and most of
                            all, the two and a half years of computer science
                            classes I took -- three semesters of which I opted
                            in for out of my own interest. As my primary
                            extracarricular, I was a member of the school's FRC
                            robotics team. On the team I was a machinist for 4
                            years, two of which I held the position of primary
                            machinist ( The duties of the primary machinist
                            included the maintinence of the mills and lathes,
                            directing and organizing the work of the other
                            machinists, and maufaturing parts out of aluminum,
                            steel, and various plastics). Due to my experience
                            on the robotics team, I chose to major in mechanical
                            engineering at Boston University. Midway through the
                            first semester of my second yer I realized I wasn't
                            reaching my full intellectual potential and it was
                            the logical decision to take time off of school to
                            work and improve myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since I left school, I've worked as a machinist, a
                            camp counselor, and currently, a mechanical
                            engineering intern. Additionally, I'm taking a Full
                            Stack Bootcamp course at Columbia University which I
                            enjoy immensely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This begs the question,
                            <b
                                >Why am I taking a CS course if I'm a mechanical
                                engineer?</b
                            >
                            I've always loved CS in addition to the machining
                            work I've done. Since I worked in the mechanichal
                            engineering division of my robotics team, I was
                            under the impression that mech E was my field. Once
                            I took time off, I started thinking about why I
                            chose mech E and I came to a realization, my primary
                            skills in the mech E department included Computed
                            Aided Design (CAD, 3D modeling), Computer Aided
                            Manufacturing (writing toolpaths to generate code
                            for machines), and metal/wood/plastic manufacturing.
                            The key point was that I specialized in
                            computer-related parts of mech E which related to
                            design and artistic ability. I've always had an
                            affinity for problem solving and it hit me,
                            througout high school, in health class, I would code
                            or CAD, not design mechanisms. At home I'd work on
                            coding problems for fun, not solder wires (although
                            I would if I had a soldering iron becase it's fun).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd love to be able to combine my mech E and
                            computer science backgrounds to build robots. The
                            process of designing, manufacturing, assembling,
                            coding, and testing to see your project come to life
                            is thrilling. Still, one has to start somewhere and
                            with a bit of mech E under my belt, it's time to
                            brush up on my code.
